Yeah.

What's that moment like? Or what's the mood that you're in versus when do you go to KFC to eat chicken? Like, can you take us through the different convenience which is more convenient? Like, both are convenient, right? 113 Speaker A\\nLike on the air. And if it's dining, it's almost in every mall or even in the neighbourhood, you can find a McDonald's. 114 Speaker B\\nI know, I know. But even KFC convenient wouldn't say, oh, it's not. 115 Speaker A\\nIt's not as convenient. 116 Speaker B\\nAlso then if you want to eat chicken, then it's like you have to make an effort to go to KFC. Yeah. 117 Speaker A\\nI think KFC is also not on grab as well, if I'm not wrong. But my frequency of ordering through grab is always. Fast food is McDonald's. 118 Speaker B\\nMcDonald's is your go to fast food. So then tell us, what does it feel like when you're craving chicken? When is it that you actually go to KFC? Make the effort. Find a KFC, go there to eat. 119 Speaker A\\nChicken, make the effort. Dine in. 120 Speaker B\\nWhat? Dine in. Or do you order KFC? 121 Speaker A\\nOkay. Order wise, it's always like a party occasion. More people gathering than we all think of. 122 Speaker B\\nWho's in that party? Is it you, your friends, family, friends gathering. 123 Speaker A\\nSo if it's like potluck, if you order chicken, chicken, KFC is the turn to as well. 124 Speaker B\\nPotluck, it's KFC chicken. 125 Speaker A\\nSorry. 126 Speaker B\\nWhen you do potluck, it's KFC chicken. 127 Speaker A\\nYeah. KFC pizza hut. It's something. Singapore is a little too. 128 Speaker B\\nYeah. Thank you. 129 Speaker A\\nIt's always western. 130 Speaker B\\nYeah. Canadian. Yeah. Yeah. The go to orders. Yeah. Well, now your food is here. Let's open. Can we? You got your chicken? The chicken piece? Yeah. Why don't you open the chicken piece? 131 Speaker A\\nOh, this one? 132 Speaker B\\nYeah. You got the McWanes? Yeah. Maybe we can look at that a bit later. I just wanted to open the chicken. Yeah. Okay. Now that you have the McCrispy here, is this the one that you ordered? 133 Speaker A\\nYes. 134 Speaker B\\nNewer one. Looking at it, how does it look like? How does it feel? What are your thoughts? 135 Speaker A\\nIt looks different, as advertised. 136 Speaker B\\nOkay. 137 Speaker A\\nYeah. Because I had tried it recently before. 138 Speaker B\\nOkay. The smell and everything. How do you find it smells different. 139 Speaker A\\nDifferent? The marination, the battle. 140 Speaker B\\nDifferent from what? 141 Speaker A\\nThe usual one I order is the Mac. The spicy one. 142 Speaker B\\nSpicy one. Okay. Okay. 143 Speaker A\\nSo the spicy one, the taste would taste and smell similar to my spicy. 144 Speaker B\\nAh, the spicy one. The batti. The spicy batti. Got it. Got it. 145 Speaker A\\nSo this one is, I would say, totally different. It's a bit different. 146 Speaker B\\nA bit different. Okay. Now why don't you try. Take a bite. What's the taste like? How does it taste? How are you feeling? 147 Speaker A\\nIt's easy to consume and it's not spicy.

So what do you like about the chicken at McDonald's else? 77 Speaker A\\nChicken? I think they are getting more innovative a bit. Yeah. Because they don't start off with chicken. 78 Speaker B\\nThey start out with bubble. 79 Speaker C\\nYeah. Chicken. My usual turn to is always KFC. 80 Speaker B\\nOh, okay. 81 Speaker A\\nYeah. So. But I realized they are getting more creative and innovative with their chicken. Like the different flavor. 82 Speaker B\\nWhat do you notice that it's not. 83 Speaker A\\nJust, it's not just spicy and unspicy. Really go with different flavors. 84 Speaker B\\nThey're trying out, like some examples. What are the flavors? 85 Speaker A\\nI can't remember. Like sometimes they lunch with the burger itself. So let's say the korean one, then the sweet and sour whatsoever. So they will couple it with the chicken as well. So when it's new, try once consistently because it's seasonal. So they will be up there and they will take it out. 86 Speaker B\\nOkay. There's more seasonal chicken burgers. Some of them. 87 Speaker A\\nChicken. Chicken. 88 Speaker B\\nYeah, chicken. 89 Speaker A\\nBut the chicken, the burger is always there. 90 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay, so the seasonal chicken, which one have you tried sweetened? The korean one you mentioned. Is that the McCrispy? 91 Speaker A\\nYeah, it's always the McCrispy that they try. 92 Speaker B\\nWhen did you first try it? I couldn't remember long back or like recent times? 93 Speaker A\\nRecent months. 94 Speaker B\\nRecent times. Okay, so what made you kind of try the McCrispy? 95 Speaker A\\nSorry? 96 Speaker B\\nWhat made you try the McCrispy? Because tumors. 97 Speaker A\\nYeah, it's always on. Yeah, we watch tv quite a bit, so it's always on Evans. 98 Speaker B\\nBut you're also a KFC fan, right? You mentioned it, yeah. So how does the chicken in McDonald's compare with all the chicken in KFC? 99 Speaker A\\nIf I consume the chicken here, it's always coupled with the burger, like a side dish. But if I go to KFC, it's going to be a main dish or chicken. Yeah. It's a different agenda. 100 Speaker B\\nOkay. So then when you order them, it's spicy here. What's your typical order? Is it like how you ordered today? 101 Speaker A\\nYeah. 102 Speaker B\\nAs a meal? 103 Speaker A\\nYeah, as a meal. Chisel drink? Yeah, usually size surprise. Usually if I'm dining with my girlfriend, then we can share the meal. Then she will just order Alakka. 104 Speaker B\\nBut you mentioned that chicken here is more like a side, but a KFC, it's the main thing you eat. 105 Speaker A\\nYeah. Yeah. 106 Speaker B\\nSo then what do you eat is the main thing for lunch at KFC. 107 Speaker A\\nSo eat two piece meat. 108 Speaker B\\nTwo piece. The same chicken. 109 Speaker A\\nYeah.

Yeah. 254 Speaker B\\nSo you can enjoy longer. So then when would you eat McCrispy chicken? Would it be when you are having a leisurely meal, you want to come relax and spend half an hour enjoying a meal? Or would it be like, okay, in and out quick? I'm busy after to get many things done, I just quickly get my crispy and eat it. So what's the scenario like? 255 Speaker A\\nMy crispy would not be in and out quick because when it comes piping hot, you can't eat past as well. Yeah, you need tiger cinnamon too. 256 Speaker B\\nSo what's the typical McCrispy meal time? Like half an hour at the minimum or. Yeah, half an hour versus a McSpicy burger. When you come to eat McSpicy, do you come with the intention of, okay, 30 minutes? I'm not gonna, you know, do anything else. Just eat. Or is it like, quick, quick, quick? 257 Speaker A\\nSame as six takes time. It's not like if I'm prepping ankle from McDonald's will be just like a simple McChicken fillet in combo down, easy to consume. So this will take time? 258 Speaker B\\nYeah, go ahead, please try whatever you like. To eat. So if this McCrispy were to become, like, a tender, or maybe could it become like a McQueen? Could the McCrispy batter marinade work for McQueen? 259 Speaker A\\nIt could be, but it definitely will not taste the same. 260 Speaker B\\nWould it replace the current McQueen, or would there be room for, like, two types of mcQueens? Crispy McQueen and original McQueen? 261 Speaker A\\nI don't think it will replace. I think it's good to have more options. 262 Speaker B\\nSo crispy mcWings and original mcwings. Okay. What else could it become? You mentioned this patty. So would the patty work well in a, like, have you tried the other products, like the wrap, the grilled chicken wrap? 263 Speaker A\\nBig Lee? I did eat before, but it's very. 264 Speaker B\\nBig. 265 Speaker C\\nMemory of it. 266 Speaker B\\nGood grilled chicken. Bee McCaspy, maybe. 267 Speaker A\\nBut this is meaning fried. 268 Speaker B\\nSo McCrispy needs to be fried to be crispy. To be McCrispy. Otherwise not genuine. Yeah. Actually that's very helpful for us to know. Like, like, when, when is it. When is it going to be genuine? Genuinely like my crispy? What can change and what cannot change? Can the meat change? Like you said, it's okay to use breast meat. 269 Speaker A\\nYeah, but I think most fast food, I usually drop it. 270 Speaker B\\nOkay. But minced meat. No, it has to be like whole meat. 271 Speaker A\\nYeah. 272 Speaker B\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And fried. Not going home. 273 Speaker A\\nYes. 274 Speaker B\\nOkay. So what about the meat itself? Can it be any other meat than chicken?

I know the feeling. Yeah. Okay. Speaking of tenders, have you tried the tenders at KFC? Yeah, no, I'm just looking at the time because I know that we also tenders. You don't. So what would make a really good tender, like, what are the qualities described? 333 Speaker A\\nJuicy. Juicy, tender. 334 Speaker B\\nTender. But is there a preference? Like should it thigh meat, press meat, lean meat more? What's like the taste and the feeling of eating high meat versus breast meat?

But to what extent does it actually think about this? Is this something that you think about? 339 Speaker A\\nThat's why I minimize the frequency of eating it. You can wait on a Monday basis. 340 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay. Okay. So the tenders. We talked about putting that in the party box along with nutties. So, like, how many tenders would be, like, nice as a snack and how many would like, can it be a meal? What would be, like, the roll of tenders on the menu? Would it be like a side. Would it be like. 341 Speaker A\\nIt could be like a nuggets. Like, the numbers are usually 4646 nuggets. Big one is 20. 342 Speaker B\\nSo four would be a small order. A side order add on. 343 Speaker A\\nNumber would be good. 344 Speaker B\\nWhat actually suggests the, you know, the product better, the word tenders or the word strips? Chicken strips or the word bites? Because some people said that tender is a very specific big fillet of the chicken breast. That's what some people say. So that's why we ask. Strips. 345 Speaker A\\nIt might be more appealing. Tenders. 346 Speaker B\\nTenders is more appealing. 347 Speaker A\\nYeah, but it would be like, okay, one bite. That's it. 348 Speaker B\\nOh, one bite might suggest. 349 Speaker A\\nBite is like a verb. So people think, like, you want me to bite? The fender is like, oh, it's like a thing that I want to eat. 350 Speaker B\\nOkay. Understand. What about breakfast? Do you get McDonald's breakfast? 351 Speaker A\\nI used to always order their big breakfast inside mall, but nowadays I only order the sausage. 352 Speaker B\\nOkay. And the wraps. You've never tried? 353 Speaker A\\nNot favorable. 354 Speaker B\\nOkay. Would mccrispies sit well in the breakfast menu? Would you order it for breakfast by itself or with the salad? 355 Speaker A\\nI think they tried before. Oh, yeah, they had the. It's like the sausage mummy. They replaced the sausage with the chicken recipe. Yeah, they do have it. This might go right. 356 Speaker B\\nOkay. 357 Speaker A\\nWith the breakfast bun. 358 Speaker B\\nYeah. So, like you said, the patty, the McCrispy, they said could come a patty itself. So would that go well with the muffin?

So what do you like about the chicken at McDonald's else? 77 Speaker A\\nChicken? I think they are getting more innovative a bit. Yeah. Because they don't start off with chicken. 78 Speaker B\\nThey start out with bubble. 79 Speaker C\\nYeah. Chicken. My usual turn to is always KFC. 80 Speaker B\\nOh, okay. 81 Speaker A\\nYeah. So. But I realized they are getting more creative and innovative with their chicken. Like the different flavor. 82 Speaker B\\nWhat do you notice that it's not. 83 Speaker A\\nJust, it's not just spicy and unspicy. Really go with different flavors. 84 Speaker B\\nThey're trying out, like some examples. What are the flavors? 85 Speaker A\\nI can't remember. Like sometimes they lunch with the burger itself. So let's say the korean one, then the sweet and sour whatsoever. So they will couple it with the chicken as well. So when it's new, try once consistently because it's seasonal. So they will be up there and they will take it out. 86 Speaker B\\nOkay. There's more seasonal chicken burgers. Some of them. 87 Speaker A\\nChicken. Chicken. 88 Speaker B\\nYeah, chicken. 89 Speaker A\\nBut the chicken, the burger is always there. 90 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay, so the seasonal chicken, which one have you tried sweetened? The korean one you mentioned. Is that the McCrispy? 91 Speaker A\\nYeah, it's always the McCrispy that they try. 92 Speaker B\\nWhen did you first try it? I couldn't remember long back or like recent times? 93 Speaker A\\nRecent months. 94 Speaker B\\nRecent times. Okay, so what made you kind of try the McCrispy? 95 Speaker A\\nSorry? 96 Speaker B\\nWhat made you try the McCrispy? Because tumors. 97 Speaker A\\nYeah, it's always on. Yeah, we watch tv quite a bit, so it's always on Evans. 98 Speaker B\\nBut you're also a KFC fan, right? You mentioned it, yeah. So how does the chicken in McDonald's compare with all the chicken in KFC? 99 Speaker A\\nIf I consume the chicken here, it's always coupled with the burger, like a side dish. But if I go to KFC, it's going to be a main dish or chicken. Yeah. It's a different agenda. 100 Speaker B\\nOkay. So then when you order them, it's spicy here. What's your typical order? Is it like how you ordered today? 101 Speaker A\\nYeah. 102 Speaker B\\nAs a meal? 103 Speaker A\\nYeah, as a meal. Chisel drink? Yeah, usually size surprise. Usually if I'm dining with my girlfriend, then we can share the meal. Then she will just order Alakka. 104 Speaker B\\nBut you mentioned that chicken here is more like a side, but a KFC, it's the main thing you eat. 105 Speaker A\\nYeah. Yeah. 106 Speaker B\\nSo then what do you eat is the main thing for lunch at KFC. 107 Speaker A\\nSo eat two piece meat. 108 Speaker B\\nTwo piece. The same chicken. 109 Speaker A\\nYeah. I used to eat, they have this value box. So it's like a single burger and a piece of chicken. That's quite value. That is quite heavy. 110 Speaker B\\nBut here, why do you say the chicken is more like a side or an add on? 111 Speaker A\\nBecause the focus is always on the burger. Yeah.

So like that would be another go to for if I'm brewing for fried chicken. 308 Speaker B\\nOkay, so what's that like? What do you like about that? Is it the batter, is it the size? Is it the way they fry it? Could you just tell the difference if you can describe the difference. 309 Speaker A\\nIt's very helpful because that would be more. Because it's a huge, huge piece of cutlet. 310 Speaker B\\nAnd then you fry it. It's like a chop. Yeah, it's like a chicken chop. But even a hawker center's resident stall has a chop. 311 Speaker A\\nBut when they do that, the kind of stall they sell sometimes with bone in. So the marination when you absorb is different as well. Yeah. And small grease here, it's more unhealthy. 312 Speaker B\\nSo what's the shilling style? Like taiwanese style? 313 Speaker A\\nCrispy. It's a breakfast crispy? Yeah. And then I think spicy. And then they have other. They put other, like plum. 314 Speaker B\\nPlum powder? 315 Speaker A\\nYeah. 316 Speaker B\\nAnd sometimes is it they use cornstarch or they use wheat flour. You think all those things too technical. You don't know? You know, sometimes some consumers are so aware. Okay, okay. 317 Speaker A\\nI do. 318 Speaker B\\nDo you like korean chicken? Do you eat korean chicken? 319 Speaker A\\nYeah. 320 Speaker B\\nAny favorites? Any. 321 Speaker A\\nPreference or. Actually, I feel it's all about the same but perfect chicken eggs. Which one? 322 Speaker B\\nWhich one is. Which one do you like to eat? 323 Speaker A\\nMy last impression, I don't know. You've heard before, there used to be this one called bonchong. Yeah. 324 Speaker B\\nWould those kind of marinades flavor be suitable for my crispy. I think they have honey. 325 Speaker A\\nI think they tried. 326 Speaker B\\nThey tried. Have you tried the honey soy? 327 Speaker A\\nYeah, yeah. A bit heavy. 328 Speaker B\\nLike a bit heavy. 329 Speaker A\\nThis is just nice. 330 Speaker B\\nJust nice. Okay. 331 Speaker A\\nLike maybe like the one, the honey one that you mentioned. I eat one piece, then I won't go for another piece. This, I might go for another one. 332 Speaker B\\nI understand. I know the feeling. Yeah. Okay. Speaking of tenders, have you tried the tenders at KFC? Yeah, no, I'm just looking at the time because I know that we also tenders. You don't.

Yeah. Because like Mac Krispies is not something that they all along have lately they came up with. 112 Speaker B\\nOkay, so let me ask you to think about when do you feel like eating a burger and come to McDonald's? What's that moment like? Or what's the mood that you're in versus when do you go to KFC to eat chicken? Like, can you take us through the different convenience which is more convenient? Like, both are convenient, right? 113 Speaker A\\nLike on the air.

One mouth. For me, I'm quite a big mouth, so one mouth. I can't really have time to savor the taste. So I like, you know, the whole point of eating is to have the second bite, the subsequent bite. Yeah. 254 Speaker B\\nSo you can enjoy longer. So then when would you eat McCrispy chicken? Would it be when you are having a leisurely meal, you want to come relax and spend half an hour enjoying a meal? Or would it be like, okay, in and out quick? I'm busy after to get many things done, I just quickly get my crispy and eat it. So what's the scenario like? 255 Speaker A\\nMy crispy would not be in and out quick because when it comes piping hot, you can't eat past as well. Yeah, you need tiger cinnamon too. 256 Speaker B\\nSo what's the typical McCrispy meal time? Like half an hour at the minimum or. Yeah, half an hour versus a McSpicy burger. When you come to eat McSpicy, do you come with the intention of, okay, 30 minutes? I'm not gonna, you know, do anything else. Just eat. Or is it like, quick, quick, quick? 257 Speaker A\\nSame as six takes time. It's not like if I'm prepping ankle from McDonald's will be just like a simple McChicken fillet in combo down, easy to consume. So this will take time? 258 Speaker B\\nYeah, go ahead, please try whatever you like. To eat. So if this McCrispy were to become, like, a tender, or maybe could it become like a McQueen? Could the McCrispy batter marinade work for McQueen? 259 Speaker A\\nIt could be, but it definitely will not taste the same. 260 Speaker B\\nWould it replace the current McQueen, or would there be room for, like, two types of mcQueens? Crispy McQueen and original McQueen? 261 Speaker A\\nI don't think it will replace. I think it's good to have more options. 262 Speaker B\\nSo crispy mcWings and original mcwings. Okay. What else could it become? You mentioned this patty. So would the patty work well in a, like, have you tried the other products, like the wrap, the grilled chicken wrap? 263 Speaker A\\nBig Lee? I did eat before, but it's very. 264 Speaker B\\nBig. 265 Speaker C\\nMemory of it. 266 Speaker B\\nGood grilled chicken. Bee McCaspy, maybe. 267 Speaker A\\nBut this is meaning fried. 268 Speaker B\\nSo McCrispy needs to be fried to be crispy. To be McCrispy. Otherwise not genuine. Yeah. Actually that's very helpful for us to know. Like, like, when, when is it. When is it going to be genuine? Genuinely like my crispy? What can change and what cannot change? Can the meat change? Like you said, it's okay to use breast meat. 269 Speaker A\\nYeah, but I think most fast food, I usually drop it. 270 Speaker B\\nOkay. But minced meat. No, it has to be like whole meat. 271 Speaker A\\nYeah. 272 Speaker B\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And fried. Not going home. 273 Speaker A\\nYes. 274 Speaker B\\nOkay. So what about the meat itself? Can it be any other meat than chicken? Canned fish, pork. 275 Speaker A\\nFish. 276 Speaker B\\nStrange. 277 Speaker A\\nI never really seen them exploring their filet o fish. 278 Speaker B\\nYeah, but we can be creative. Do you think that, do you think that the crispy could go to other types of meat or should it only be chicken?\\n\\nuse this context for the text excerpt : This chunk is a discussion about the respondent's preference for McDonald's chicken, specifically the McCrispy, and how it compares to KFC chicken.

So what do you like about the chicken at McDonald's else? 77 Speaker A\\nChicken? I think they are getting more innovative a bit. Yeah. Because they don't start off with chicken. 78 Speaker B\\nThey start out with bubble. 79 Speaker C\\nYeah. Chicken. My usual turn to is always KFC. 80 Speaker B\\nOh, okay. 81 Speaker A\\nYeah. So. But I realized they are getting more creative and innovative with their chicken. Like the different flavor. 82 Speaker B\\nWhat do you notice that it's not. 83 Speaker A\\nJust, it's not just spicy and unspicy. Really go with different flavors. 84 Speaker B\\nThey're trying out, like some examples. What are the flavors? 85 Speaker A\\nI can't remember. Like sometimes they lunch with the burger itself. So let's say the korean one, then the sweet and sour whatsoever. So they will couple it with the chicken as well. So when it's new, try once consistently because it's seasonal. So they will be up there and they will take it out. 86 Speaker B\\nOkay. There's more seasonal chicken burgers. Some of them. 87 Speaker A\\nChicken. Chicken. 88 Speaker B\\nYeah, chicken. 89 Speaker A\\nBut the chicken, the burger is always there. 90 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay, so the seasonal chicken, which one have you tried sweetened? The korean one you mentioned. Is that the McCrispy? 91 Speaker A\\nYeah, it's always the McCrispy that they try. 92 Speaker B\\nWhen did you first try it? I couldn't remember long back or like recent times? 93 Speaker A\\nRecent months. 94 Speaker B\\nRecent times. Okay, so what made you kind of try the McCrispy? 95 Speaker A\\nSorry? 96 Speaker B\\nWhat made you try the McCrispy? Because tumors. 97 Speaker A\\nYeah, it's always on. Yeah, we watch tv quite a bit, so it's always on Evans. 98 Speaker B\\nBut you're also a KFC fan, right? You mentioned it, yeah. So how does the chicken in McDonald's compare with all the chicken in KFC? 99 Speaker A\\nIf I consume the chicken here, it's always coupled with the burger, like a side dish. But if I go to KFC, it's going to be a main dish or chicken. Yeah. It's a different agenda. 100 Speaker B\\nOkay. So then when you order them, it's spicy here. What's your typical order? Is it like how you ordered today? 101 Speaker A\\nYeah. 102 Speaker B\\nAs a meal? 103 Speaker A\\nYeah, as a meal. Chisel drink? Yeah, usually size surprise. Usually if I'm dining with my girlfriend, then we can share the meal. Then she will just order Alakka. 104 Speaker B\\nBut you mentioned that chicken here is more like a side, but a KFC, it's the main thing you eat. 105 Speaker A\\nYeah. Yeah. 106 Speaker B\\nSo then what do you eat is the main thing for lunch at KFC. 107 Speaker A\\nSo eat two piece meat. 108 Speaker B\\nTwo piece. The same chicken. 109 Speaker A\\nYeah. I used to eat, they have this value box. So it's like a single burger and a piece of chicken. That's quite value. That is quite heavy. 110 Speaker B\\nBut here, why do you say the chicken is more like a side or an add on? 111 Speaker A\\nBecause the focus is always on the burger. Yeah. Because like Mac Krispies is not something that they all along have lately they came up with. 112 Speaker B\\nOkay, so let me ask you to think about when do you feel like eating a burger and come to McDonald's? What's that moment like? Or what's the mood that you're in versus when do you go to KFC to eat chicken? Like, can you take us through the different convenience which is more convenient? Like, both are convenient, right? 113 Speaker A\\nLike on the air. And if it's dining, it's almost in every mall or even in the neighbourhood, you can find a McDonald's. 114 Speaker B\\nI know, I know.\\n\\nuse this context for the text excerpt : This chunk is a discussion about the potential for McCrispy chicken to be incorporated into other McDonald's menu items, specifically tenders and breakfast options. \\n\\nKeywords: McCrispy, tenders, breakfast, McMuffin, chicken, McDonald's, menu,  \\n\\ntext excerpt : This chunk is a discussion about the potential for McCrispy chicken to be incorporated into other McDonald's menu items, specifically tenders and breakfast options. \\n\\nKeywords: McCrispy, tenders, breakfast, McMuffin, chicken, McDonald's, menu,  \\n\\n325 Speaker A\\nI think they tried. 326 Speaker B\\nThey tried. Have you tried the honey soy? 327 Speaker A\\nYeah, yeah. A bit heavy. 328 Speaker B\\nLike a bit heavy. 329 Speaker A\\nThis is just nice. 330 Speaker B\\nJust nice. Okay. 331 Speaker A\\nLike maybe like the one, the honey one that you mentioned. I eat one piece, then I won't go for another piece. This, I might go for another one. 332 Speaker B\\nI understand. I know the feeling. Yeah. Okay. Speaking of tenders, have you tried the tenders at KFC? Yeah, no, I'm just looking at the time because I know that we also tenders. You don't. So what would make a really good tender, like, what are the qualities described? 333 Speaker A\\nJuicy. Juicy, tender. 334 Speaker B\\nTender. But is there a preference? Like should it thigh meat, press meat, lean meat more? What's like the taste and the feeling of eating high meat versus breast meat? Easier to eat as well. 335 Speaker A\\nEasily dry. 336 Speaker B\\nEasily dry. 337 Speaker A\\nSo it might not savor the somehow time it does. Look at it. It's like we see unhealthy earlier. 338 Speaker B\\nYeah, but does it bother, I mean, does it actually bother people? Everybody says that it's greasy, unhealthy, etcetera, etcetera. But to what extent does it actually think about this? Is this something that you think about? 339 Speaker A\\nThat's why I minimize the frequency of eating it. You can wait on a Monday basis. 340 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay. Okay. So the tenders. We talked about putting that in the party box along with nutties. So, like, how many tenders would be, like, nice as a snack and how many would like, can it be a meal? What would be, like, the roll of tenders on the menu? Would it be like a side. Would it be like. 341 Speaker A\\nIt could be like a nuggets. Like, the numbers are usually 4646 nuggets. Big one is 20. 342 Speaker B\\nSo four would be a small order. A side order add on. 343 Speaker A\\nNumber would be good. 344 Speaker B\\nWhat actually suggests the, you know, the product better, the word tenders or the word strips? Chicken strips or the word bites? Because some people said that tender is a very specific big fillet of the chicken breast. That's what some people say. So that's why we ask. Strips. 345 Speaker A\\nIt might be more appealing. Tenders. 346 Speaker B\\nTenders is more appealing. 347 Speaker A\\nYeah, but it would be like, okay, one bite. That's it. 348 Speaker B\\nOh, one bite might suggest. 349 Speaker A\\nBite is like a verb. So people think, like, you want me to bite? The fender is like, oh, it's like a thing that I want to eat. 350 Speaker B\\nOkay. Understand. What about breakfast? Do you get McDonald's breakfast? 351 Speaker A\\nI used to always order their big breakfast inside mall, but nowadays I only order the sausage. 352 Speaker B\\nOkay. And the wraps. You've never tried? 353 Speaker A\\nNot favorable. 354 Speaker B\\nOkay. Would mccrispies sit well in the breakfast menu? Would you order it for breakfast by itself or with the salad? 355 Speaker A\\nI think they tried before. Oh, yeah, they had the. It's like the sausage mummy. They replaced the sausage with the chicken recipe. Yeah, they do have it. This might go right. 356 Speaker B\\nOkay. 357 Speaker A\\nWith the breakfast bun. 358 Speaker B\\nYeah. So, like you said, the patty, the McCrispy, they said could come a patty itself. So would that go well with the muffin? McMuffin? 359 Speaker A\\nYeah, it does. 360 Speaker B\\nSo that could be an option. So I think that's a good match, good mix.\\n\\nuse this context for the text excerpt : This chunk is a discussion about what makes chicken interesting and fun to eat, as opposed to boring.

I'm not saying hopping like, but can see you have this chicken bucket, it could be an option. 300 Speaker B\\nThe chippeast you find is a really interesting chicken product that's like really interesting, fun, and not boring. My question is, some people say that chicken is a bit boring. I mean, it's familiar. We eat it every day, so it's a bit boring. So are there any chicken products that you actually consider fun, interesting, different, that you look forward to eating that's not boring? Any parts of the chicken, any item of chicken, either at McDonald's or capesie or anywhere else? 301 Speaker A\\nLet me think. 302 Speaker B\\nThere has to be faster. Doesn't have to be what's a really interesting recipe for chicken or interesting chicken item that you've eaten? 303 Speaker A\\nIf I'm not going to patronize McDonald's or KFC or if I'm serving for fried chicken, chicken. 304 Speaker B\\nYeah, yeah. 305 Speaker A\\nI'll go to those. Like, I don't know, you've heard before those like eateries, they sell just chicken cutlets, big chicken cutter. Like shilling or shilling. 306 Speaker B\\nThe hot potato taiwanese market. Yeah. The Taiwan. Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Those street food, the Taiwan street food. 307 Speaker A\\nYeah. But they fry the fried huge chicken cutlet. So like that would be another go to for if I'm brewing for fried chicken. 308 Speaker B\\nOkay, so what's that like? What do you like about that? Is it the batter, is it the size? Is it the way they fry it? Could you just tell the difference if you can describe the difference. 309 Speaker A\\nIt's very helpful because that would be more. Because it's a huge, huge piece of cutlet. 310 Speaker B\\nAnd then you fry it. It's like a chop. Yeah, it's like a chicken chop. But even a hawker center's resident stall has a chop. 311 Speaker A\\nBut when they do that, the kind of stall they sell sometimes with bone in. So the marination when you absorb is different as well. Yeah. And small grease here, it's more unhealthy. 312 Speaker B\\nSo what's the shilling style? Like taiwanese style? 313 Speaker A\\nCrispy. It's a breakfast crispy? Yeah. And then I think spicy. And then they have other. They put other, like plum. 314 Speaker B\\nPlum powder? 315 Speaker A\\nYeah. 316 Speaker B\\nAnd sometimes is it they use cornstarch or they use wheat flour. You think all those things too technical. You don't know? You know, sometimes some consumers are so aware. Okay, okay. 317 Speaker A\\nI do. 318 Speaker B\\nDo you like korean chicken? Do you eat korean chicken? 319 Speaker A\\nYeah. 320 Speaker B\\nAny favorites? Any. 321 Speaker A\\nPreference or. Actually, I feel it's all about the same but perfect chicken eggs. Which one? 322 Speaker B\\nWhich one is. Which one do you like to eat? 323 Speaker A\\nMy last impression, I don't know. You've heard before, there used to be this one called bonchong. Yeah. 324 Speaker B\\nWould those kind of marinades flavor be suitable for my crispy. I think they have honey. 325 Speaker A\\nI think they tried. 326 Speaker B\\nThey tried. Have you tried the honey soy? 327 Speaker A\\nYeah, yeah. A bit heavy. 328 Speaker B\\nLike a bit heavy. 329 Speaker A\\nThis is just nice. 330 Speaker B\\nJust nice. Okay. 331 Speaker A\\nLike maybe like the one, the honey one that you mentioned. I eat one piece, then I won't go for another piece. This, I might go for another one. 332 Speaker B\\nI understand. I know the feeling. Yeah. Okay. Speaking of tenders, have you tried the tenders at KFC? Yeah, no, I'm just looking at the time because I know that we also tenders. You don't. So what would make a really good tender, like, what are the qualities described?\\n\",\n",

Especially with chicken, its best origin. 222 Speaker B\\nOh, really? Okay. Yeah. So then what could make it really very compelling for you to come to McDonald's to eat McFee? 223 Speaker A\\nI think if it's gonna make it like a meal, like a main course for people to come here and eat it, I think the idea, like a value box. 224 Speaker B\\nSo what should we put in the value box of chicken? 225 Speaker A\\nIf it's, like, heavily on focusing on chicken? 226 Speaker B\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Spotlight is on this, like, this one. 227 Speaker A\\nNuggets. What else do you have? Oh, they have just the cutlet. Maybe a piece of it. 228 Speaker B\\nOh, just the patty? 229 Speaker A\\nYeah. 230 Speaker B\\nAh, okay, that's good. 231 Speaker A\\nI add on that on the meal. 232 Speaker B\\nOh, that's actually a very good idea that you've shared. Just have this McCrispy chicken as a patty, somewhat similar to the thai piece, but the thigh piece has a small bone in it. Right? 233 Speaker A\\nYeah. 234 Speaker B\\nOkay, so what other forms could this McCris be? Chicken, take one is just one. Is this thai patty just a patty. The other is. Could it come as tenders strips? 235 Speaker A\\nIt could be. You mean, like. 236 Speaker B\\nYeah, with this marination and with this external tender. 237 Speaker A\\nBecause they have this party box. 238 Speaker B\\nRight. 239 Speaker A\\nSo they have MC wings and mcnuggets. If this has a new party box that includes that with, like, tenders. 240 Speaker B\\nAh, it could go in the party box. The tenders. 241 Speaker A\\nSometimes me and my friends, we do order. We don't go for meals. We just go for the box. Like, I feel like munching or something. That is something that we go do as well. Like, if, like, if we do not order KFC, we ordered box from McDonald's, that would be an option. Good option. 242 Speaker B\\nSo if it's tenders, should it actually be the breast meat, the chicken tender breast tender meat? Or can it be thigh meat? 243 Speaker A\\nI think it doesn't matter if it's utilizing this new marination, if it's the marination. So it doesn't matter. Just like nuggets as well. So marinations. 244 Speaker B\\nBut should it be whole meat, or can it also be like, minced meat? Like, should it be made from whole meat, or can it be like, minced meat? Like nuggets, people tell me are made with whole meat. 245 Speaker A\\nBecause when you mince it nuggets, then it's not so much focusing on me, it's more on the batter. Like, you know, even nuggets, they have new ones, like the spicy McDonalds and everything. So you're focusing on the marination, the crust. Only meat doesn't really get the essence of that. 246 Speaker B\\nSo what does whole meat signify to you? Like, you consider this whole meat. Right? Like, it's. So what does it convey to you? 247 Speaker A\\nDoes it convey. 248 Speaker B\\nYeah. Versus minced meat versus markets. 249 Speaker A\\nWhy this. 250 Speaker B\\nYeah, why do you like it more filling. Any other things you associate with the whole meat? 251 Speaker A\\nMore time to savour the taste. 252 Speaker B\\nMore time to savor the taste compared. 253 Speaker A\\nTo just like a McNuggets, like a mincemeat. One mouth. For me, I'm quite a big mouth, so one mouth. I can't really have time to savor the taste. So I like, you know, the whole point of eating is to have the second bite, the subsequent bite.

The spicy one. 142 Speaker B\\nSpicy one. Okay. Okay. 143 Speaker A\\nSo the spicy one, the taste would taste and smell similar to my spicy. 144 Speaker B\\nAh, the spicy one. The batti. The spicy batti. Got it. Got it. 145 Speaker A\\nSo this one is, I would say, totally different. It's a bit different. 146 Speaker B\\nA bit different. Okay. Now why don't you try. Take a bite. What's the taste like? How does it taste? How are you feeling? 147 Speaker A\\nIt's easy to consume and it's not spicy. And it's the fragrance. 148 Speaker B\\nThere's still some fragrance.

And visually like the meat inside. What do you think about the meat? The quality, etcetera? 151 Speaker A\\nBecause my preference usually is not drumstick, but usually it's a Thai, but it's good enough to have feedback. 152 Speaker B\\nWhy do you like the Thai more than the drumstick? 153 Speaker A\\nI always feel it's more meat. 154 Speaker B\\nMine has more meat. This one is more bomb. 155 Speaker A\\nLike.

Be able to pick the part? 159 Speaker A\\nIf there is an option, I would choose. 160 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay. Can you tell this is McCrispy from McDonald's? If you didn't see it with the wrapping, if it was in somebody's potluck and already opened and placed in a plate, would you know if it's McDonald's and not KFC? 161 Speaker A\\nSo maybe I can tell. 162 Speaker B\\nYou can tell, but when you taste it, also, can you tell if it's my first time? No. No. Now that you know, I mean, like, now, would you be able to tell? Yeah, you know? Okay. You can recognize it's McCrispy. So what is giving it away? How do you know it's McCrispy and not KFC? 163 Speaker A\\nEven though it's not spicy, but I think the base of the marination is quite similar to the ingredients. I might not know the ingredients, but this is taste. You can tell it's okay. Okay. 164 Speaker B\\nSame. From the same kitchen? Same kitchen. Okay. Okay. On a scale of one to ten, how good is this crispy? 165 Speaker A\\nEight, I guess. 166 Speaker B\\nEight. Is there an ideal that you like? That's a ten. Would you give ten to any? 167 Speaker A\\nIf it's a Thai, there will be ten. 168 Speaker B\\nIt's a Thai. This is ten. Okay. Not KFC. Is there another plant and another passport that you have to give a ten? 169 Speaker A\\nIf I'm eating this now, but I think I'm KFC. 170 Speaker B\\nNo, my question is, if you have, like, an ideal. Your ideal chicken, which one is your ideal chicken? One that you like most, like KFC product or, you know, any other classmates. So would you give a ten for that? 171 Speaker A\\nYeah. 172 Speaker B\\nYeah. So this one, in comparison is how much? 173 Speaker A\\nSlightly short? Four. But. 174 Speaker B\\nSo what's like. What's it. Where is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 175 Speaker A\\nI think I still prefer it spicy. Yeah, but this is something new.

Do you think that, do you think that the crispy could go to other types of meat or should it only be chicken?\\n\\nuse this context for the text excerpt : This chunk is a discussion between the interviewer and interviewee about what could make the McCrispy chicken more appealing to the interviewee.

Especially with chicken, its best origin. 222 Speaker B\\nOh, really? Okay. Yeah. So then what could make it really very compelling for you to come to McDonald's to eat McFee? 223 Speaker A\\nI think if it's gonna make it like a meal, like a main course for people to come here and eat it, I think the idea, like a value box. 224 Speaker B\\nSo what should we put in the value box of chicken? 225 Speaker A\\nIf it's, like, heavily on focusing on chicken? 226 Speaker B\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Spotlight is on this, like, this one. 227 Speaker A\\nNuggets. What else do you have? Oh, they have just the cutlet. Maybe a piece of it. 228 Speaker B\\nOh, just the patty? 229 Speaker A\\nYeah. 230 Speaker B\\nAh, okay, that's good. 231 Speaker A\\nI add on that on the meal. 232 Speaker B\\nOh, that's actually a very good idea that you've shared. Just have this McCrispy chicken as a patty, somewhat similar to the thai piece, but the thigh piece has a small bone in it. Right? 233 Speaker A\\nYeah. 234 Speaker B\\nOkay, so what other forms could this McCris be? Chicken, take one is just one. Is this thai patty just a patty. The other is. Could it come as tenders strips? 235 Speaker A\\nIt could be. You mean, like. 236 Speaker B\\nYeah, with this marination and with this external tender. 237 Speaker A\\nBecause they have this party box. 238 Speaker B\\nRight. 239 Speaker A\\nSo they have MC wings and mcnuggets. If this has a new party box that includes that with, like, tenders. 240 Speaker B\\nAh, it could go in the party box. The tenders. 241 Speaker A\\nSometimes me and my friends, we do order. We don't go for meals. We just go for the box. Like, I feel like munching or something. That is something that we go do as well. Like, if, like, if we do not order KFC, we ordered box from McDonald's, that would be an option. Good option. 242 Speaker B\\nSo if it's tenders, should it actually be the breast meat, the chicken tender breast tender meat? Or can it be thigh meat? 243 Speaker A\\nI think it doesn't matter if it's utilizing this new marination, if it's the marination. So it doesn't matter. Just like nuggets as well. So marinations. 244 Speaker B\\nBut should it be whole meat, or can it also be like, minced meat? Like, should it be made from whole meat, or can it be like, minced meat? Like nuggets, people tell me are made with whole meat. 245 Speaker A\\nBecause when you mince it nuggets, then it's not so much focusing on me, it's more on the batter. Like, you know, even nuggets, they have new ones, like the spicy McDonalds and everything. So you're focusing on the marination, the crust. Only meat doesn't really get the essence of that. 246 Speaker B\\nSo what does whole meat signify to you? Like, you consider this whole meat. Right? Like, it's. So what does it convey to you? 247 Speaker A\\nDoes it convey. 248 Speaker B\\nYeah. Versus minced meat versus markets. 249 Speaker A\\nWhy this. 250 Speaker B\\nYeah, why do you like it more filling. Any other things you associate with the whole meat? 251 Speaker A\\nMore time to savour the taste. 252 Speaker B\\nMore time to savor the taste compared. 253 Speaker A\\nTo just like a McNuggets, like a mincemeat. One mouth. For me, I'm quite a big mouth, so one mouth. I can't really have time to savor the taste. So I like, you know, the whole point of eating is to have the second bite, the subsequent bite. Yeah. 254 Speaker B\\nSo you can enjoy longer. So then when would you eat McCrispy chicken?\\n\\nuse this context for the text excerpt : Context: This chunk is a conversation between two people, one of whom is a marketing researcher, about the new McCrispy chicken product at McDonald's.

The spicy one. 142 Speaker B\\nSpicy one. Okay. Okay. 143 Speaker A\\nSo the spicy one, the taste would taste and smell similar to my spicy. 144 Speaker B\\nAh, the spicy one. The batti. The spicy batti. Got it. Got it. 145 Speaker A\\nSo this one is, I would say, totally different. It's a bit different. 146 Speaker B\\nA bit different. Okay. Now why don't you try. Take a bite. What's the taste like? How does it taste? How are you feeling? 147 Speaker A\\nIt's easy to consume and it's not spicy. And it's the fragrance. 148 Speaker B\\nThere's still some fragrance. How would you describe the flavor so much? Like. 149 Speaker A\\nIt'S a bit of. Not so much of spices, but yeah. But the aftertaste is quite pleasant. 150 Speaker B\\nPleasant. And visually like the meat inside. What do you think about the meat? The quality, etcetera? 151 Speaker A\\nBecause my preference usually is not drumstick, but usually it's a Thai, but it's good enough to have feedback. 152 Speaker B\\nWhy do you like the Thai more than the drumstick? 153 Speaker A\\nI always feel it's more meat. 154 Speaker B\\nMine has more meat. This one is more bomb. 155 Speaker A\\nLike. If I ordered chicken rice, I wouldn't order chopstick. 156 Speaker B\\nOkay. 157 Speaker A\\nYeah. 158 Speaker B\\nThen would you like an option where you can get just the thigh as the side? Be able to pick the part? 159 Speaker A\\nIf there is an option, I would choose. 160 Speaker B\\nOkay. Okay. Can you tell this is McCrispy from McDonald's? If you didn't see it with the wrapping, if it was in somebody's potluck and already opened and placed in a plate, would you know if it's McDonald's and not KFC? 161 Speaker A\\nSo maybe I can tell. 162 Speaker B\\nYou can tell, but when you taste it, also, can you tell if it's my first time? No. No. Now that you know, I mean, like, now, would you be able to tell? Yeah, you know? Okay. You can recognize it's McCrispy. So what is giving it away? How do you know it's McCrispy and not KFC? 163 Speaker A\\nEven though it's not spicy, but I think the base of the marination is quite similar to the ingredients. I might not know the ingredients, but this is taste. You can tell it's okay. Okay. 164 Speaker B\\nSame. From the same kitchen? Same kitchen. Okay. Okay. On a scale of one to ten, how good is this crispy? 165 Speaker A\\nEight, I guess. 166 Speaker B\\nEight. Is there an ideal that you like? That's a ten. Would you give ten to any? 167 Speaker A\\nIf it's a Thai, there will be ten. 168 Speaker B\\nIt's a Thai. This is ten. Okay. Not KFC. Is there another plant and another passport that you have to give a ten? 169 Speaker A\\nIf I'm eating this now, but I think I'm KFC. 170 Speaker B\\nNo, my question is, if you have, like, an ideal. Your ideal chicken, which one is your ideal chicken? One that you like most, like KFC product or, you know, any other classmates. So would you give a ten for that? 171 Speaker A\\nYeah. 172 Speaker B\\nYeah. So this one, in comparison is how much? 173 Speaker A\\nSlightly short? Four. But. 174 Speaker B\\nSo what's like. What's it. Where is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 175 Speaker A\\nI think I still prefer it spicy. Yeah, but this is something new. That's why the rating is quite high. 176 Speaker B\\nOkay. 177 Speaker A\\nI'm someone that don't mind trying new meat as long as chicken, because chicken.\\n\",\n",
